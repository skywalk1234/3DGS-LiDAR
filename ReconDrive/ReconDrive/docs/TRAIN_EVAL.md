## Training
ReconDrive training consists of two main stages. Pretrained and trained checkpoints for stage 2, are listed below.

### Stage-two: ReconDrive Training with Two-Frame Inputs

In the second stage, we train the final ReconDrive models.
  ```
  # Firstly, download the pretrained stage1 checkpoints and link it to $pretrained_stage1_checkpoint=./checkpoints/recondrive_stage1.ckpt
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${GPU_IDs} bash scripts/train.sh ${GPU_NUM}
  ```


## Evaluation

  ```
  # Download the recondrive_stage2.ckpt and link it to ./checkpoints/recondrive_stage2.ckpt
  # Currently, inference only support single-GPU mode
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${GPU_ID} bash scripts/inference.sh
  ```
